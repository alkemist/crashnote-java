Crashnote consists of a few base modules that form the foundation of the library:

- **core**: base classes for collecting, modelling and sending data
- **logger**: integration with Java's logging frameworks
- **web**: extending core module with web concepts
- **test**: utility classes for testing


The libary also borrows from a few solid open source resources:

- **json**: rendering the JSON data format ([json-simple](https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/))
- **config**: loading and parsing of configuration settings ([typesafehub/config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config))
