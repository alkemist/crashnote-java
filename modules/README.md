Crashnote consists of a few base modules that form the foundation of the library:

- **core**: base classes for collecting, modelling and sending data
- **logger**: integration with Java's logging frameworks
- **web**: extending core module with web concepts
- **test**: utility classes for testing


The libary also borrows from a few solid open source resources:

- **json**: rendering the JSON data format
- **config**: loading and parsing of configuration settings
